# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **Kazi Anwar**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Summary

**WannaHearAJoke?** is an android app that **displays a random joke of different types such as a knock knock joke, a general one or programming from the jokes API**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ðŸ˜­ðŸ¥²ðŸ˜‚**

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [X] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [X] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a query to the API request
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [X] Made logo
- [X] Changed background color and tint
- [X] Changed text color

## API Choice

**My chosen API for this project is official_joke_api. The api documentation can be found here: https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api and the API displays three types of data which are type, setup and puncline.**

## Video Demo

Here's a video / GIF that demos all of the app's implemented features:

## Notes

Finding an API that functioned as intended was super hard. API keys rarely worked and same with the glide library. Most of the free APIs had a limit of requests per hour and it was super difficult to parse the data. Thankfully after a lot of digging I found one I liked which was simple enough for me to work with!
